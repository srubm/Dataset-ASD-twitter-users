It's a little embarrassing, but I've had little success with Google in my niche, and PMax campaigns are the very first time that I've gotten really solid prospecting purchases in a short period of time from any Google campaign. It's nice, but it's super black boxy.

I have my opinions obviously, but I've always been fascinated by how the overall look/approach of a film impacts what VFX can pull off, even with all the time/$ in the world. At some point the illusion breaks when the aesthetic is fighting you.

So I think it'll still be big.

Even more overhead for the very tiny group that needs it (beyond what a Mac Studio can now offer) and the room for enough PCI cards is really the only reason for a Mac Pro to exist anymore.

Too many movies being made still in a finance/distrib structure that provides no compound interest for the filmmakers, no longterm plan... gig economy filmmaking... no ongoing audience relationship. It's not sustainable.🤷‍♂️

Then again we did get i9's in normal iMacs recently. It is a little confusing though, what they consider Pro or not Pro.

M1 they stretched far. I see M1 Pro and M1 Max as no different. Who knows if iMP as a product will even continue. Hard to say. I think M1 Max in a MBP/Mac Mini will destroy my current iMP.

So are you saying you sorta consider it to be an 8K camera that simply has 12K oversampling, sorta how the Alexa was a oversampled sensor w/HD&amp;2K downsample (w/eventual open gate). Original C300 was similar. Oversampling w/4K sensor but 1080 image."

In 2015 I did it pretty hardcore from Aug-March to drop 70lb. This time I'de like to lose at least 20, or aim for 30 and get down to my lowest ever as an adult. All I know is seeing 200 on a scale again is a big no no... 200 is the gateway to 240 again lol.

Yea I'de only ever want the full sensor 4K. I'de expect the crop to be worse for sure. You're right DR past a certain usable point is on the shooter, but I'de definitely want the one with best results overall. I guess the 12K Ursa is it.

On their site they mention: ""You can shoot 12K at 60 fps or use in-sensor scaling to allow 8K or 4K RAW at up to 120 fps without cropping or changing your field of view."" But then I see windowing mentioned later. Confusing."

I'm guessing if you use the 12K in 4K mode, the noise gets super small as well. No Prores is a bummer though.

More resolution but lower DR overall, so curious your thoughts? Even at the same price, from what I've seen the 4.6K G2 is still the more attractive option, but maybe I'm missing something. How are you liking it so far?

Everywhere is essentially becoming Youtube, unless you're on a HUGE streamer. Amazon opening up their whole platform to almost anyone worked for a while but I doubt margins held.

Lots of people had listings changed on them and weren't aware at all after the policy shift. IMDBTV is the new frontier for Amazon and they keep pushing things there. Prime SVOD eyeballs/revenue hit a wall a year ago for many.

Lots of documentaries, due to Amazon's new policy, straight-up disappeared recently.

Haven’t been in a theater since Tenet. I’ve seen a bunch of movies at home lately. Nothing beats a theater viewing/audio experience. It’s not even close, and no I don’t care what TV or sound system you have. Thanks @AMCTheatres it’s good to be back.

IMO more than 1/2 the reason people like it more is simply that you have more time to get to know and understand the characters. Any cut that's 2hrs would probably suck... too much packed too tight.

It bottomed at $75 today and doubled in 45min, the moves on a minute by minute basis are huge. Halts are nothing new, especially with swings that hard. They'd do it on Apple too if it was moving like this.

Treating them all like they're the same person is exactly what gave us a Donald Trump. Biden can't shoulder all the weight of healing. We need to talk to each other.

Not everyone advertising on FB is doing something shady. If there’s less overall competition for a participar audience, the inventory opens up some more. That’s how it works, similar to the holidays when everyone spends more and CPMs increase. It’s normal.
