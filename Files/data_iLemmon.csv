However, you do not need to be in crisis to seek therapy. It is preventative care, just like seeing the dentist or chiropractor. Maintenance like that should be normal.

Just as we’ve been talking about how not being racist isn’t the same as being anti-racist, not being sexist isn’t the same as being anti-sexist. Misogyny isn’t the insult you think it is, it simply refers to the larger system.

That starts with loving them for who they are, not for what they do for you.
