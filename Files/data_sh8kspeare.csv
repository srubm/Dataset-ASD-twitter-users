I started out reading CLAMP and still love their work: “Cardcaptor Sakura”, “Tokyo Babylon”… I also enjoy “Nozaki-kun” for fun (good anime too). Yuu Watase has some interesting magical romance stuff; “Fushigi Yuugi” is an old-school staple."

People who worry too much about the ""rules"" of writing, or about somehow doing it ""wrong"" usually end up too scared to be free with their imaginations and writing. Lose the chains! Write now, fix later."

As a beta reader, it's key to be constructive. Try to tell the author more than ""I like this"" or ""I don't like this."" If you can, explain WHY something does or doesn't work. Point out anything confusing, or places where a character behaves in ways that don't fit."

Don't publish your first draft. Use critique partners, use beta readers, take the time to do it right.

Have a professional make your cover.

It's frustrating. Because it suggests those who struggle just aren't good, or aren't trying hard enough. Which isn't necessarily true.
