If a meltdown is in public, then it can be a nightmare to deal with these feelings afterwards.

Temperature sensitivity is a big thing but obviously no one knew or cared. But I was basically deeply uncomfortable all the time at school. #autism

The injustice of some teachers' disciplinary acts was way too much to handle sometimes. Common techniques, such as punishing a class or telling someone off for standing up to bullying infuriated me and made me suspicious of authority. #autism

I found lessons with a practical element too chaotic and out of routine to be enjoyable. Technology lessons, science experiments and so on were always cause for increased anxiety. #autism

Linked to this, so much at school was a popularity contest, often supported by the teachers. Being autistic didn't tend to make people particularly popular, so ostracision from the rest swiftly follows. #autism

The transition of getting changed was something I could never handle and the bullying by the PE staff of folk like me who couldn't catch, throw of run was just awful. #autism #dyspraxia

My need to fidget and doodle to keep me calm and less anxious always conflicted with teachers' expectations. It wasn't til 6th form that a teacher actually allowed me to doodle. Up to that point there was always the possibility of getting into trouble. #autism

I despised my school uniform, especially when I went to a school with a shirt/blazer requirement. I was forced to have the top button done up, which is sensory hell for me. Spent all my time feeling strangled. Horrible. #autism #sensorysensitivity

Break and lunchtime were OK when I had my friends around, but a few times when we'd fallen out, or they were ill, the isolation was intense. There really was nowhere safe to go. I'd typically just sit in the playground waiting for the bell. #autism

Transitions between lessons or tasks were hard to manage. I'd often be immersed in a bit of work, only to be wrenched from it at lesson change over. I hated this so much. Also, moving between lessons was a source of intense anxiety due to how busy the corridors were. #autism

I defaulted either to clowning around as a reaction to increased stress, or I fell silent hoping no one would involve me. The social rules among kids in this situation were impossible to discern. #autism

A mighty disrespect for authority, but blended with a desire to never rock the boat. I didn't recognise any teacher's inherent authority over me at all. However, I was so keen to disappear into the background that I never really acted on it and just got on with it. #autism

This will be chronicled in my upcoming book but lets just say my interests were extremely powerful for me and I am inordinately passionate about them even now. #autism #autistic

I think that can go both ways for autistic people but for me I was extraordinarily risk averse as a kid or teenager. Never broke a bone as a result, so that's something. #autism #autistic

Way more than I think was 'acceptable'. Never full on school skipping - I was ill, it's just often I think it was illness caused by anxiety. My happiest childhood memories are days off eating soup watching daytime TV with my mother. #autism

I had a severe aversion to jeans, right up until I was about 18 or so (at which point societal pressure was just too much).

I had a very small circle of friends and often concentrated on one of them at a time for a while, unable to view them as a whole group. As such, at times I was probably distant with close friends from time to time. #autism #autistic

We won't tend to parent by unwritten rule or implication, which can reduce stress a lot for children (think about how some teachers, for example, seemed so inscrutable and hard to understand - parents too).

Does your autistic uncle really have to wear a scratchy wacky woollen jumper? The answer is no. You might like it, but the discomfort of unfamiliar, itchy clothing for most autistic people is bloody horrible and will ruin our day more than is not wearing them ruins yours.

Don't enforce collective jollity like singing or games - this can be highly stressful and anxiety-inducing for some autistic people due to the social intensity of it all. By all means do that stuff but if an autistic family member can't take part, be mindful of that. #autism

Some autistic people hate surprises of any kind (making us extremely anxious and stressed) and it's better to just tell them what's happening, even if that goes against your idea of Christmas. #autism

Tradition is no reason to force an autistic person, whose dislike is likely to be very real and visceral, to eat something they don't like.

1. Allow them time to decompress alone if they need it, especially if you're having a big family get together. Don't make them feel bad about needing this."

The 'spectrum' is a troublesome idea at best, and doesn't visualise autism adequately at all. And autism is a definite thing - you either are, or aren't. There's no inbetween state. So no-it's a bad idea and pretty nasty to see as an autistic person.

Autistic people don't tend to view power hierarchies as particularly relevant. This can cause interesting interactions between them and people in positions of power. The autistic worldview seems to be extremely egalitarian.

Autistic people learn to 'mask', which means acting like non-autistic people. This costs us a lot of energy and wellbeing, and often leads to meltdown and burnout. Sadly it's expected of us by society, which is very bad.

Very common and always unhelpful. All you'll do is force us to push our natural needs and traits deep down, and pretend to be non-autistic (masking), which is likely to result in serious burnout. #autism"

Seriously, think twice about handshakes, hugs, cheek kissing and all of that stuff. Many autistic people are incredibly sensitive to touch and/or hate unasked physical contact. Placing arbitrary social mores above another human's comfort is pretty bad."

However, wondering who may have been, in a speculative informal way (ie not writing academic texts decreeing it all), in order to link back to the autistic past (which existed but is essentially erased from history) is harmless.

Stating categorically that any historical figure was autistic is a bad move, in so much as it's making grand claims based on very little, and cultures shift and change making it even harder to say. This kind of certainty is not great.

All autistic people have them to some extent, and like stimming they help regulation of mood. But sometimes we can be told off, for example my lego interest is 'childish', and we have them removed.

This happens too often as no one ever seems to believe us when we say 'we can't do much more'. I've been pushed beyond my capacity so often.

We love routine because it gives us a modicum of control over things, which we typically lack. As we are so often completely stressed out, this is vital.
