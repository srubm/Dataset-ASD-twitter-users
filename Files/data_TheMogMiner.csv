Time Traveler itself is actually a bad initial test case since we don't emulate the appropriate LD player, but it's the best capture I currently have access to, so it at least lets me prove out the pipeline.

My goal with MAME, when I first started contributing in 2001, was to help a project that I loved. But now I've realized that the more data-driven a project gets, the more it enables community involvement. And dating back to 1997, MAME has so wide of a community.

That's just from memory, and there are many more. MAME is trending further in that direction: Using the project's Lua bindings, someone who knows nothing about C++ can still make plugins that do killer things. Someone ported @SethBling's MarI/O to work with our framework.

It may have simply been that the software calculated everything at 16 bits per channel internally in order to have higher-precision results.

Various film-studio-grade software packages advertised 16 bits per channel, which would give you legit 48-bit color, and 256x the color resolution per-channel.

So the calling code can simply call 0x1E8 instead, skipping the add, to evaluate sin() instead - a clever way to reduce code size.

Sounds like the inverse situation of the CD-i: Even on an 8088, you can probably stream data off the HDD faster than you can update the screen.

With the CD-i, you're sporting a 10MHz 68010-equivalent, and end up waiting on I/O instead."

As the ordering in QVariantMap is based on the ordering of the keys, the keyframes end up serialized into JSON, and written into the project XML, out-of-order.

It's rare to hear the flat affect in person, talking to other auties."

MAME has skeleton drivers for a boatload of music keyboards, even if the main CPU happens to be a microcontroller (known or not) with an internal ROM. As long as there's something dumpable, it can be included, and documented as well as possible.

When the battery goes, so does the key. Fortunately, it's been thoroughly reverse-engineered and can now have the key restored.

Some were used by only one or two games, some were used by a fairly large chunk. So it's not entirely the same situation with the CD-i.

The N64 had a vector coprocessor (the RSP) which handled the calculation side of both the graphics and audio stack. HLE-ing the N64 still required reverse-engineering the routines uploaded to the RSP.

If not you, then your third-party contractors. Why have we not had any updates in over a week on this critical issue?

If luma is being held constant across a given NTSC signal line, then the jailbars wouldn't happen at all, right?

An image being compressed or uncompressed can often have little effect on the resulting size, and so additional actions on the part of the application cannot be reliably inferred by a user from such a selection.

My gripe isn't so much about whether or not there's still an option to post the image inline in the chat, it's about whether or not the option which has subsumed it makes the end result clear, and I don't feel that it does.

You can literally dumpster-dive a PC that can run modern MAME. Your excuse for MAME2003 doesn't hold water."

In the mixer stage, they use a pair of LM324 op-amps as comparators, except in this case you can clearly see +5V run through a resistor to get +2V, which is then plumbed to the minus legs of the op-amps. https://t.co/HKO7md4IVl"

It could legit be using some sick side effect of using the op-amp incorrectly.

For now, though, I'm just going to wire up +1.2V instead and call it a day."

What is going on here?"

I'd chalk it up to a typo, but then the same thing is done for a different sound effect.

556 output is a square wave from 0V to +12V when a sound effect is on. R80/R81 junction swings from 0V to +3V.

LM324 outputs a constant -4.95V. https://t.co/yxqgmgoEQM"
