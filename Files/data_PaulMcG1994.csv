Cost of living going down will allow people to spend more on extra things whereas increased wages will push the price of everything up further as the increase needs to be covered and will probably cause job losses

Can't blame the pitch. We've got the team to win comfortably but need the performance. I'd rest Maeda and Hatate though. Both have looked knackered lately. Big Giakoumakis upfront is a must

Abada is currently our top scorer in the league and he only has 9. It's only good because he's a winger too and a lot of players have scored for us in the league

Me being autistic shouldn't have ever been an issue especially given the near panic attacks and breathlessness that occured when I tried a mask before they came in

If you want to mask do it but ultimately you only control you so don't judge anyone else for doing what they're allowed to do. There's been so much virtue signalling with masks and it's so bad

I don't think Boli is a bad player at all plus he's rapid whereas Taylor is the best defensively of the 3 but slower although not ultra slow like some think. Scales isn't agile enough but expected with his height. Would suit a CB/CDM more

As a squad though, it's as good as it could have been given Ange has been here effectively 6 months"

For me it's RW, if Abada gets injured you're relying on Forrest who's been out for a long time and will take time to get up to speed and Dembele who should be loaned out. Yes Jota can play there but injuries and internationals limit that

As I've said you don't become top scorer of the Dutch league with no strengths. Ange signed him knowing he's a completely different type of forward to Maeda/Kyogo too. You need that to be successful

The logic behind 500 at a football stadium is badly lacking too. My local Tesco can have 500 in 10 mins no bother on a normal day with no distancing and it's indoors unlike football

If the SNP get better it's more than likely to get the maybes into very confident yes votes. That's something everyone should want. Until polls are constant at 60% minimum yes this isn't a done thing. Still loads to do

Lewis also gained an advantage at the beginning by leaving the track and didn't have to give it back then Wolff begged that a safety car wasn't used early on"

Only bothered by the fact my work has a policy that even with a cold you're really not meant to be in incase it affects anyone or happens to actually be Covid.
