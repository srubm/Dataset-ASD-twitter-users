People easily accept that fantasy characters are going to be different races, genders, sexualities, etc. from us, but when I write a human? I'm terrified people will push back on me even trying to write an enby Mexican.

I also think that visual novels are the perfect storytelling medium and I'm sad that they aren't more popular in the West. My favorite work of fiction ever is a visual novel (Umineko).

I thought everyone got them on occasion! 🤣 Maybe it's cuz I liked to look up at the sky when I was a kid, but I saw them all the time and my childish headcanon was that they were angels.

I think the Terran series needs to wait a bit... until some real-world cultural trends die down a bit.

But in the future, they'll make a more socialist steampunk society.

Clockwork had once been associated with the tyranny of the era fixed by the Greed Wars, when rioters in Aloutia had destroyed their overlords’ clockwork structures in rage."

It's human in every way except it can read minds? I'm interested. That would still be human, though.

In Ophidia, only women are even taught to read. Any woman who wants to access historical records may do so, though they might not be easily accessible for the poor/working women."

A lot of people would have no problems at all, and would integrate seamlessly into an Aloutian lifestyle. Many other people, including religious or greedy people, will struggle to accept a world where their God isn't real and greed is sinful.

Mostly flowers and birds irl, but in the PD, some species who can see in ultraviolet have clothes dyed/houses painted in colors only they can truly perceive. The Hive is a city that looks plain to visitors, but stunning to the citizens.

Their whole economy is based on chattel slavery. MoKaM features an intersex person who has to sneak through on her travels. In MoDaH, Tynan has to transform into a woman to work there.

The descendants of Gods down to three generations can use magic and are called Godbloods. If someone drinks a God's blood and acquires magic, they're called drinkers, and may eventually become Demigods.

Since the book is written in 1st person from his POV, that means the reader gets to see these thoughts. He's no longer safe in his one dimension, though. He's interacting with a mind reader and cannot stop thinking the worst thoughts about him, lol.

Some people (like me) genuinely enjoy reading neat descriptions! But in fantasy especially, PLEASE describe things whether they're important to the plot or not.

The Water Realm is mostly underwater, for instance, and the Fire Realm resembles what we might think Hell looks like, but it's really quite nice if you're a Fire elemental person.

If they aren't asleep, a shinigami will put them to sleep. The shinigami then take them to Spiritua, the plane of the deceased. Shinigami are the servants of the God of Death, and Tynan will become one.

However, right now they're working for their father, a lawkeeper (police). This scene takes place after the events of MoDaH, the book I plan to write next. The Merchants novels take place ""within each other."" https://t.co/pVrdEdNBTG"

Most places in Aloutia have completely gotten rid of them. Where Amiere lives, for instance, they slaughtered the last of their nobles during the Greed Wars and have instituted a system where nobility cannot exist.

So when one fucks up, usually their whole house is destroyed.

Thought, creativity, cunningness, opinions. He's worshipped during the Bacchanalia not for his powers, exactly, but because he conquered the world/saved it from demonkind.

Or it might be ""Zakuro is taller than Calinthe."" Knowing their precise height in cm or feet/inches isn't important... except when it is, lol. For instance, Lulu loves the number 8 and he's 8'8"" tall."

We just have people we enjoy talking to so we do it frequently, and from an outsider, that looks like a clique. Some would probably say you and I are in a clique, AD, since we talk and we're with SSP. 🤷‍♀️

MoKaM and MoLaB characters were appearances first, names second. MoDaH characters were named a long time ago and their appearance has to fit preestablished lore. Since they're Godbloods, they have to resemble their God-parents.

Happy St. Patrick's Day! 🍀 I am going to keep writing MoLaB now, and then next hour, try to record some voice samples.

Like, I'd always thought that books could only have letters or numbers in the text. To see a little drawing of a coffin blew my fucking mind. 😂

My author name and display name are the same, though. Still, I will contact customer support if they don't get it resolved in a few days. I think I just need my publisher to answer their email, and that should happen in a few days.

I gave them my email, my publisher's email (though to be fair, they only check it on certain days, so they MAY not have seen it. 😂) and I linked to it on Amazon. I don't have a Facebook, which was one thing they wanted. or a Kindle Direct email.

I avoided social media for a long time because I was scared of that kind of behavior. I feel blessed to have found a nice community of people here on Twitter.

Alpha readers and CPs are more for in-progress works. I would recommend *not* paying beta readers, as there's a tendency for them to only say nice things in hopes that you'll continue paying them. You want honesty.

MoKaM is a 2 on that scale, lol. Calinthe is aroace, though some of the friendship stuff between her and Zakuro could be read as 'romantic'

MoLaB is a 7. Amiere is romantic, but his relationships are already established. https://t.co/FgjBhhepXS"

Since I don't have time for that, it's boring, and the MCs don't think of it, I use footnotes.

It will make you feel betrayed so much. 😭 But also makes you appreciate some things that you may have thought were way worse.

I should relisten to Our Fake History's episode on it. They tackle a lot of historical myths and I remember they did one on all the myths surrounding the Black Plague."

There was a population explosion of Godbloods in Ophidia... by which I mean 50 Godbloods were born. Aloutia wanted to match that."

If they believe Lucognidus doesn't deserve/isn't fit to be God, they will lose their blessings. Other elementals can believe whatever and they'll be fine.

I enjoy some of his books, others less so. At the end of the day, I guess all I can say is that I think I've outgrown him, though. But Hero of Ages still has the best ending to any media I've ever experienced, for personal reasons.

I like to predict where the characters will go, where treasures might be, where the big bad might be lurking. Some of that joy comes from playing video games where maps would be intentionally designed for players to explore.

I have a theoretical question, though: since each god always comes back as the same species, what if, through some cataclysmic/genocidal events, all members of a given species were wiped out? Could they be brought back in any way? Or is that a 'god permadeath' scenario?

One of my favorite characters, who makes a brief but memorable appearance in MoKaM, is General Phoebe Economos. She's a fucking badass who was sent to kill a very powerful man... and succeeded. Then she chose to work for Aloutia instead of Ophidia."

When you mix materials inside Ayuthiel's Crucible, then add a drop of the Pixie of Evil's blood, you get a demon. Their offspring might also be demons, though if they breed with a species, they'd be considered that species

Just letting you know that it was already pointed out, and I've already fixed it.

Since MoLaB is in Scrivener right now, I have been narrowing the window, which causes the words to go on new lines.

When she was a child, her mother 'taught' her many liquids, so having to learn new ones doesn't come up.

The last merchant of magic to gain any prominence worked for Ophidia. 😅

She's tired because her work is exhausting, not because she's old. She would be tired even if she kept her body at a younger age, like the other Gods do. She likes being in an 'older' body because she feels wiser that way.

Before each Bacchante participates in the festival, she will pray to the Mind God, basically thanking him for letting the party be possible because if he hadn't conquered the world, they'd still be sex slaves to demons.

The Twenty Thousand thing is a religious epithet for how he can be in ten thousand places at once. It's also a reference to the 'eyes' on a peacock's tail. Lucognidus's symbol (one of them) are peacocks and the ocelli are said to be his eyes.

Sawyer chose her to drink his blood. Technically that picture isn't canonical because Sawyer is deceased and Requiem is alive (so they can't interact like that), but I wanted it for symbolic purposes.

Thora from @MBlackrane's series.
Obito from @5FeetofRedFury's series. I also like Akuko more than I should admit. 😅
I admire the Emperor from @WakahisaSensei's book."
