The icy rain is loud but it’s not like hail. I struggle to explain it to people back home in MN. We don’t get much snow but the ice accumulates and causes destruction. And bc no one has shovels or salt or plows, we just have to wait it out.

So - if we are stuck with SETs right now, imna focus my work on how to make the use less bad.
