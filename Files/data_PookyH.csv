I once fell flat the floor on the dance floor (there was a bubble machine) at a wedding I was working the bar at.  I was carrying a tray of empty glasses at the time.  No injuries but BIG embarrassment (but I got SO many tips that night, people must have pitied me?)

My tips: 

1. Always stop writing when you have more to say and leave yourself a prompt then it’s easy to get going again. 

2. Have a writing routine &amp; rituals 

3. Schedule breaks and lean into them

You’ve got this."

How do you do that / how much do you save etc. Great idea!

1)Tom came climbing for the first time since March, I love climbing together 
2)Paying a sincere compliment that clearly meant a lot to the recipient
3)Lots of chairs to move but four legged help made it feel less arduous
