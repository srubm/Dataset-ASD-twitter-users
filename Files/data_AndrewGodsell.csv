Anyone for tennis?  

The Tories took £160,000 from a Russian donor, to play tennis with Johnson. 

Johnson subsequently attempted to suppress the #RussiaReport, and has since failed to act on its recommendations.

Is the going rate to meet Johnson £160,000?

Have just Retweeted this from @davenellist a member of the @Socialist_party.

The name Tory Party was coined in 1681 - a Tory was an Irish outlaw!

Tories were re-branded the Conservative Party in 1830. 

Throughout history they have sought to conserve their own wealth and power. 

Please RT if you agree.
