When autistic people get close to someone, they get REALLY close. Like, a friend’s needs elevate to one of your special interests (and when I describe it like that, it sounds creepy, but it’s affection I promise!)

Like all things autistic, it’s pathologized as clinginess. https://t.co/TmDlKnyw1s"

The three most recent, Star Trek [2009], Into Darkness, and Beyond are very much made to appeal to non-Trekkies and can be fun, but I wouldn't say they best showcase what Star Trek offers. But they are accessible.
