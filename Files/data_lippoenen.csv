They are harder to rehome due to the stigma attached to them. If you don't like pits then by all means don't have one.

It's not just pits that end up in shelters, they just happen to be one of the hardest breeds to remove due to the stigma attached to them. I've worked as a volunteer at my local humane society so I have a bit of experience with this issue.

Imagine what will happen if the next demagogue is actually intellectually gifted and a talented orator. It sends a chill up ones spine.
