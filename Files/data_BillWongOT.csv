1. If you are an OTP who is trying to make ends meet, I think the price point will be too prohibitive. Experiencing it once will probably be a once in a career item so that you can say that you experienced it."

If you have time crunch in organizing these events, you can always recruit more than 1 prospective student. However, you still have to make sure everything is up to code because such events are most likely under your event license. 5/

It is not a bad idea to recruit prospective students who can support your weaknesses as a licensee/organizer.

Finding our roles and purposes in the greater OT community is a process. Yes, it took me being on the brink of #autisticburnout to find it. But, now I know more about what I like/dislike in OT.

So, if you are the licensee of the corresponding event, people actually won’t know that you were behind it unless they look into the event’s profile on TED.

But, if you are the person behind the scenes, it is OK to toot your horn on OT forums and say, “By the way, I was the brainchild of the video you see here.”

If you feel that sending a connect/follow on social media is too random, consider sending that person a direct message along with the request.

Then, as time goes on when the therapist asks you for new needs, then you can refer to that again.

In some health professional fields, % of autistics in them is a microscopic one.
