Well, hot weather in these months is closely tied to dry air in SoCal. Up until the 1930s, Pasadena was farmland with few established trees. Now, the big, dense (wet) urban forest may prevent 80F days. https://t.co/AIAqIXb3sD"

An outer eyewall forms, expanding the wind field, but lowering the maximum wind.

The net result is a worse human impact since more will see an eyewall."

In September/Oct/Nov, the onshore flow stops. Cool Pacific can't help us anymore, and dry descending air from the Great Basin heats up fast.

In winter, sun angle means everything. The instant the solstice passes, we slowly begin to warm."
