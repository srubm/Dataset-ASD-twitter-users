Ballydoyle has had 3-32 beaten 0.5L or less but the average defeat has been 8.5L which signifies poor yard form.👍"

She did look well ahead of her mark last time so could go well but it's NO BET AT THE PRICE for me I' afraid. 😃👍

She is on her way back in. It looks a very strange betting market so it'll be interesting to see how she goes. 😃🤞👍

I've tipped her and both the Racing Post and Oddschecker are on her so I thought she would go off around 5/1-7/1. It's not looking likely.👍

It's an 8-runner race &amp; looks ideal for each way punters but I really struggled to figure out which horse would be 2nd. I narrowed it down to Chantry House, Shan Blue, &amp; Asterion Forlonge."

Ran a blinder and we were a little unlucky taking nothing away from the excellent winner. 👍

Unbeaten now in 11 and this being her toughest test to date she is quickly becoming a superstar.

In races where I don't have a strong opinion which horse is going to win I will try to narrow down the field for you guys. 😃👍

He is still entered in the Supreme but highly unlikely to line up there with the 2m5f Ballymore trip much more suitable. He may still have ran in the Supreme if the ground had become bog like but that looks unlikely at this late stage. 👍

The winner comes from Appreciate It, Metier, Ballyadam, Soaring Glory or Blue Lord IMO. I don't see too much else getting in to it but Paul Kealy has gone for Irascible at 25/1. 😃👍

He pulled-up on his only Cheltenham start. Nube Negra looks a safer E/W option at 10's but Chacun Pour Soi will be hard to beat. 👍"

He'll be running on but will he get there? Good luck if you've had a bet. 🤞

She was either unfit (but given her record fresh it's probably not that) so maybe hasn't trained on. It'll have to be a watching brief next time after that performance. 👍

You tell us what price is value to bet a horse at but not at what price it is no longer value. The problem is I can quickly tell when a horse is over-priced but to say when the value ends I need to do a full analysis of the race. Make sense? https://t.co/4UhplejqAC

He made a small mistake 4/5 out where he also got a little hampered. He was impressive over 3m1f at Punchestown so I knew he ideally wanted further. I think he can win off his current mark.👍

I think he'll go off a fair bit shorter. Let's hope we get a run for our money. 🤞

The 2m5f Ballymore or the 3-mile Albert Bartlett do look more likely.

Perhaps either of them would be so kind as to firm up her target as it makes Ante Post betting difficult from a punters perspective? 😃

It didn't help that he had been sent off at 125/1 last time!

For me, Zafaranah was the value bet though at 12/1 v 15/8. Good luck!🤞

Reasons - it is hard to get a bet on early at the odds you want on an exchange due to a lack of liquidity but you will get a better return by laying it off there as opposed to cashing out.

Her running on late again may suggest she already needs further than 7f &amp; her pedigree would help support this. 👍"

Firstly, you want to make the biggest profit if your horse wins so if you back them as proposed you actually make least profit if she wins. You're averaging approx £33 profit for any result which means all your doing is putting £50 on a place bet at crap odds of 4/6.

Even at 4/1 professional punters would be playing the E/W, or adopting even more sophisticated staking, to protect their investment. 👍

I've no doubt he's well-handicapped off 115 and after watching the replay of his last run he looked on his way back. 🤞

He is the yard's top chance on jockey bookings &amp; won his last 2 races easily on fast ground. Rob Hornby says ""He'll appreciate a bit more cut in the ground"". York's galloping track will also suit. He's up 6lb but there's no knowing where his ceiling will be. 👍"

At big prices we are inevitably going to get a much lower strike rate but if you back them all the winners will make you a good long-term profit. 👍

He never looked happy. The first-time cheek-pieces are a possible explanation. The RP gave the fast going as a possible excuse but it should have suited. He's much better than he showed. 👍

His Sire's pedigree is misleading having only ran 3 times at 6f but he was out of Gorband by Sheroog who both stayed 1m2f so who's to say his Sire wouldn't have stayed further than 6f had he tried longer trips.

So, starting with a £500 bankroll I would recommend 0.5 PTS Each Way (£5 each way) or a 1 PT Win bet (£10 win). Double your stake for Naps. Make sense ok? 😃👍

Good luck today! 🤞

It was a very good race ran in a fast time and he simply wasn't good enough. No obvious excuses can be made for him so he now looks regressive and is one to avoid until he shows an upturn in form IMO. 👍

I would have much preferred Andrea Atzeni, who is 2-2 on him, to be in the saddle. He remains a horse to be seriously interested in as it's only a matter of time before he gets his head in front again. 👍

He was very impressive last time out &amp; won't be far away. Is he value at 7/4?

I specifically put Shoot To Win out around 11pm last night because I could see he was going to shorten overnight whether I tipped him or not. 👍

To be honest, I'm betting plenty (mainly out of boredom) with some success on both the Australian racing and at the American tracks. I'm quickly learning a lot but I'm not sure I'm anywhere near expert level yet so no tips at this stage anyway. Good luck! 😀🤞

Betfair is offering 1/5 against the racing being back on in the UK by the 1st of May so I'd like to think, taking in to account all the information I've heard about the virus, that it would be odds against being back on by August. I'd take Evens. 😀🤞👍
