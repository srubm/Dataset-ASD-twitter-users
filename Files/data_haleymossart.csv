Benevolent ableism is good faith, but speaks over or silences autistic &amp; disabled people, where neurotypical, nondisabled people decide what‚Äôs best for us without our consent.

It robs us of self-advocacy &amp; independence. It can be a subtle form of exclusion."

Genuine help is consensual. Autistic or disabled people will accept an offer of help or ask for help.

Benevolent ableism happens when well-intentioned people attempt to help when it‚Äôs neither asked for nor wanted."
