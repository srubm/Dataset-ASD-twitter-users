A med that helps you with emotional regulation (some ADHD meds do that, some more than others), then it could be. Strattera and Guanfacine/clonidine are the best ones for this.

So I wonder if the same gene could be involved in other cases (people without CFS/ME) and if having it could predispose you to it in the future.

The latter isn't used for allergies, mostly for insomnia. So it might be stronger but idk

It's also a strong sedative. I use it for both ADHD and hyperPots, the sedative effect is a bonus.

There's a lot of stuff we might wanna do, and in that moment we feel like we can. But deep down we know we might never (because there's a pattern).

I'm not as strict with it, but it does sooth me a lot (also, I forget where I've parked if I don't). It's not as big of a reason but it also plays a part.

Just take your meds and go. No support, no sources, no nothing. Figure it out yourself. I see so many people diagnosed as kids that just now are understanding what having ADHD entails.

Just because some have working coping mechanisms doesn't mean they're healthy. They will stop working eventually. And by then the damage is already done and the frustration and mental health decline is in place.
