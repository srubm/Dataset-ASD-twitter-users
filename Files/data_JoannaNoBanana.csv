That's why I tried not to take it for so long. However, I've encountered quite a few people who are just med shaming for no reason imo

I started my mcas meds with famotidine which is an h2 blocker bc amoxicillin messed up my stomach so badly that I couldn’t even keep down water. It also helps me feel hungry.

H1 helped with allergies too.

Oral cromolyn sodium was a major help 1/2"

Covid does cause neurological symptoms so that may be a result of that. For example loss of scent is a neurological symptom.

I do also have a butterfly rash so I think for me it’s something triggering my MCAS but my loss of scent make it difficult to figure out what’s bothering me. I’m also still dealing with a post covid flare up.

I didn’t actively try to go up the entire time but that’s my 2 cents on it. It may be worth revisiting and starting with a really small dose. Some people start with like 1/8th of a vial of 100mg. Personally I started with 100mg per day and that took me a while 2/3

Some doctors prescribe the average dose right away (800ml per day) but you’re supposed to start really small and slowly build your way up. I’m on 300-400 per day and I’ve been taking it 1/2

I propose the Tortoiseshell cat as our MCAS mascot.

They’re thought to be rare but they aren’t actually rare. (Just like how MCAS is underdiagnosed) 

They’re much more common as female cats similar to how MCAS tends to mostly affect women. 1/2 https://t.co/XckF6Q2Epd"

What was your experience with beta blockers? Did it take a while to get used to them?

(I just took propranolol for the first time. My arms and legs went numb. I know this med is used for high BP while mine tends to be low so I wonder if that’s why.)"

Different people with different disabilities/chronic illnesses (and sometimes even the same but different symptoms/severity) need different accommodations. I'm sure those kids with cancer and their parents wouldn't approve of them being used in that manner.

Yeah it seems like the 10,000+ steps was just too much for the time being. Also things like when you take your meds and how much come into play to complicate it further.

It’s important to start slow and steady and build up over time. Also strength exercises tend to be more histamine friendly from my understanding. 3/3

Exercise releases histamines for everyone. Definitely something to be careful about with mcas.

It's related to histamines, so you may be interested in maybe doing morning workouts before eating and before the stress of the day. That may help with the itching.

Polish is my first language so I can speak on that best. There isn’t (to my knowledge) a word that symbolizes someone is disabled that has more of a positive or at least non-neg connotation.

In my experience with languages a lot of them lack a word like “disabled.” A lot of these words tend to be more similar to terms like “invalid” or “handicapped.” I’ve noticed that in Polish."

First of all, ableism is real. Just because you claim it doesn’t exist, it doesn’t mean that it doesn’t exist.

Secondly, everyone deserves basic necessities such as food, water, shelter, etc. Living isn’t just for people who can be considered productive 1/2 https://t.co/Ky1VGnF3WK"
